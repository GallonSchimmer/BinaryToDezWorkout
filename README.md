# BinaryToDezWorkout

This project, developed using Eclipse, involves a Java application for converting binary numbers to decimal numbers. It includes classes for manipulating binary arrays and performing conversions.

## Usage

The application provides two different approaches for binary-to-decimal conversions. The `BinaryToDezApp` class offers a simple demonstration of the conversion process, while the `BinaryToDezInput` class enables users to input their own binary values for conversion.

## Requirements

- Java
- Eclipse IDE

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run either the `BinaryToDezApp` or the `BinaryToDezInput` class to see the output.

## Classes

### BinaryArray

This class contains a set of exponential values used in the conversion process.

### BinaryToDezApp

This class demonstrates the binary-to-decimal conversion process with a predefined binary number.

### BinaryToDezInput

This class enables users to input a binary value and converts it to its corresponding decimal value.
